#React-Router-Login-Test

just playing around with react router and its ability to redirect and prompt the user.

this seems to make for an smooth login process and will be good for compartmentalizing parts of the app

with this type of login we can make it so certain actions are only usable to people that are logged in or that have accounts with your app
